	           values(1, "White", "Important species of the white ash group are American whiteash 
	                      (Fraxinus americana), green ash (F. pennsylvanica), blue ash (F. quadrangulata),
                                      and Oregon ash (F. latifolia). The first three species grow in the eastern half of the United States. Oregon 
                                      ash grows along the Pacific Coast. The heartwood of the white ash group is brown, and the sapwood is 
                                      light-colored or nearly white. Second-growth trees are particularly sought after because of the inherent 
                                      qualities of the wood from these trees: it is heavy, strong, hard, and stiff, and it has high resistance to shock. 
                                      Oregon ash has somewhat lower strength properties than American white ash, but it is used for similar purposes 
                                      on the West Coast. American white ash is used principally for nonstriking tool handles, oars, baseball bats, and other
                                      sporting and athletic goods. For handles of the best grade, some handle specifications call for not less than 2 nor more 
                                      than 7 growth rings per centimeter (not less than 5 nor more than 17 growth rings per inch). The additional weight requirement 
                                      of 690 kg/m3 (43 lb/ft3) or more at 12% moisture content ensures high quality material. Principal uses for the white ash
                                      group are decorative veneer, cabinets, furniture, flooring, millwork, and crates.",

                           values(2, "Black", "Black cherry (Prunus serotina) is sometimes known as cherry, wild black cherry, and wild cherry. It is the only native 
                                      species of the genus Prunus of commercial importance for lumber production. Black cherry is found from southeastern Canada 
                                      throughout the eastern half of the United States. Production is centered chiefly in the Middle Atlantic States. The heartwood of 
                                     black cherry varies from light to dark reddish brown and has a distinctive luster. The nearly white sapwood is narrow in old-growth 
                                     trees and wider in second growth trees. The wood has a fairly uniform texture and very good machining properties. It is moderately 
                                     heavy, strong, stiff, and moderately hard; it has high shock resistance and moderately high shrinkage. Black cherry is very dimensionally 
                                     stable after drying. Black cherry is used principally for furniture, fine veneer panels, and architectural woodwork. Other uses include burial

                           values(3, "Cucumber", "	Commercial magnolia consists of three species: southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), sweetbay (M. virginiana), and 
                                      cucumbertree (M. acuminata). Other names for southern magnolia are evergreen magnolia, big laurel, bull bay, and laurel bay. Sweetbay is 
                                      sometimes called swamp magnolia. The lumber produced by all three species is simply called magnolia. The natural range of sweetbay extends 
                                      along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts from Long Island to Texas, and that of southern magnolia extends from North Carolina to Texas. Cucumbertree 
                                      grows from the Appalachians to the Ozarks northward to Ohio. Louisiana leads in the production of magnolia lumber. Sapwood of southern magnolia 
                                      is yellowish white, and heartwood is light to dark brown with a tinge of yellow or green. The wood, which has close, uniform texture and is generally 
                                      straight grained, closely resembles yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). It is moderately heavy, moderately low in shrinkage, moderately low in bending 
                                      and compressive strength, moderately hard and stiff, and moderately high in shock resistance. Sweet bay is much like southern magnolia. The wood of cucumber 
                                      tree is similar to that of yellow poplar (L.tulipifera); cucumber tree that grows in the yellow poplar range is not separated from that species on the market. Magnolia 
                                      lumber is used principally in the manufacture of furniture, boxes, pallets, venetian blinds, sashes, doors, veneer, and millwork.",
